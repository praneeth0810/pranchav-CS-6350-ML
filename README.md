# pranchav-CS-6350-ML

This is a machine learning library developed by Praneeth Chavva for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah

**Decision Tree:**

Run `bash run.sh` to access the menu options for applying a decision tree classifier on two datasets, using three methods for calculating information gain: entropy, majority error, and Gini index. It also provides the option to set a maximum depth to prune the tree.

**Ensemble Learning:**

Run `bash run.sh` to choose between models such as AdaBoost, Bagging, and Random Forest.

**Linear Regression:**

Run `bash run.sh` to select between Batch Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and the optimal weight vector approaches.

**Perceptron:**

Run `bash run.sh` to execute the Perceptron program, which supports standard, voted, and average Perceptron algorithms.

**SVM:**

Run `bash run.sh` to choose from the primal, dual, Gaussian SVM, and Kernel Perceptron models.

**Neural Networks (NN):**

Run `bash run.sh` to select from implementations of neural networks, including manual, SGD, and PyTorch-based approaches.

**Logistic Regression:**

Run `bash run.sh` to execute the code for both MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) and MLE (Maximum Likelihood Estimation) logistic regression models.
